# Why am I here
read me

My name is misterSir and I'm keen on coding.
 I've discovered it about a year ago and for now I've got something that I maybe can call
 experience. I've worked in Swift with iPhone/iPad apps for almost a year. At the same time
 I started learning web-development but due to my studies I've stopped it after BootsTrap and ended 
 on the basis of JavaScript and for now I start to learn Python 3.x.x.
